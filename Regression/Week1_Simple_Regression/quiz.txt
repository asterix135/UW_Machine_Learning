I
1. y = w_0 * w_1 + log(w_1) * x
2. True   (wrong: right answer is worse???)
3. Might
4. It is impossible to tell  (wrong)
5. algo to min/max a function
6. estimate model parameters
7. too large: not converge
   too small: too slow
8. Let's analyze how many computations are required to fit a multiple linear regression model using the closed-form solution based on a data set with 50 observations and 10 features. In the videos, we said that computing the inverse of the 10x10 matrix (H^T)H was on the order of D^3 operations. Let's focus on forming this matrix prior to inversion. How many multiplications are required to form the matrix (H^T)H?

Please enter a single numeric value.
1000 (wrong)
9. O(N^2D + D^3) (wrong: More generally, if you have D features and N observations what is the total complexity of computing ((H^T)H)^(-1)? )
